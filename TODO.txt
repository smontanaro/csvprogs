Some to-do tasks before release

* Scrub all TradeLink references, including #! paths, example usage in doc
  strings, and TL-specific Makefile targets.

* Unify the command line args across programs where it makes sense.  For
  example, some programs reference column headings using -f, others using
  -k. Separator characters are also specified using multiple command line
  args.

* Convert to Python 3 syntax.

* Rewrite sharpe.sh as Python.
