## Introduction ##

I worked with [John Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Hunter)
for several years at [TradeLink](https://tradelinkllc.com/). Though I
never actually did anything with Matplotlib while John was still alive, I
used CSV files a fair amount and eventually decided I needed to plot
columns from time-to-time. Writing my plotter using Matplotlib in
rememberance of John seemed like a good thing.

I don't claim that this is a "good" example of Matplotlib. It grew
organically over time as the need arose, and I've never tried to get fancy
wth Matplotlib. It thus has a rather eclectic (baroque?  non-intuitive?)
command line interface. Its callable API is brand new as of September 2022
and is still pretty bug-ridden. *Caveat emptor*.
